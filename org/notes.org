** Review questions:

1. What are my views on using generative AI when learning how to code?
   #+begin_quote
     "Don't do it." For the long version, see my pamphlet "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.org][About [not]
     Using AI to Write Code For You]]"

2. What does IMRaD stand for and why is it relevant to us?
   #+begin_quote
   - "Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion" is the standard
     format of scientific publications.
   - Our project sprint reviews follow IMRaD: in each sprint, one of
     these is the central concern.

3. What's the purpose of a sprint review in Scrum?
   #+begin_quote
   Presentation of a prototype, which is whatever the project team has
   created by then (perhaps nothing). It's not the same as a milestone
   (which is a date at which a particular result is expected).
   #+end_quote
4. Which of these do not apply to the projects in this course:
   - [ ] Use a project from another course in this class.
   - [ ] Explore a dataset of your choice that you are curious about.
   - [ ] Explore an R or Python package of your choice.
   - [ ] Complete a DataCamp competition and report on it.
   - [ ] Create a demo that your audience can participate in.
5. True or false? You can complete your DataCamp assignments any time.
   #+begin_quote
   True - but you will suffer a 50% point loss for late completion.
   #+end_quote
6. What is "Google Cloud Shell"?
   #+begin_quote
   A free cloud application that offers an editor (looks like VSCode)
   and a command-line or shell program. Allows 50 hours computing time
   per week and 5GB of space. The Emacs installation is permanent, the
   installation of R, alas, is not.
