/Image:/ comparing the expected difficulty (smooth curve) to the actual
difficulty (step function) of a class or of a technical book.

What did we achieve: Just a little overview and exposure to Linux and
Emacs using the Google Cloud Shell platform (while waiting for Lyon's
Linux server). See also: review questions in week 2.

* Week 2 - Infrastructure & Introduction to Data Science

- *DataCamp:* make sure that you subscribe to my workspace, and that you
  can see the assignments. Where can you find the invitation link?
  #+begin_quote
  The link was posted in Google Chat and you can find it in Canvas in
  the Wiki page "Course links".
  #+end_quote

- *Project:* published [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2628/assignments/32556][1st sprint review instructions]] - get to work!
  #+begin_quote
  1) Pick a team
  2) Pick a topic (or topics)
  3) Write a proposal
  4) Submit your proposal
  #+end_quote

- *Review questions from week 1*

- *Getting started with infrastructure*:
  1. [ ] Linux exercise (to be finished)
  2. [ ] Emacs tutorial
  3. [ ] Datalab demo

** Review questions:

1. What are my views on using generative AI when learning how to code?
   #+begin_quote
   "Don't do it." For the long version, see my pamphlet "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall24/UsingAItoCode.org][About [not]
   Using AI to Write Code For You]]"
   #+end_quote
2. What does IMRaD stand for and why is it relevant to us?
   #+begin_quote
   - "Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion" is the standard
     format of scientific publications.
   - Our project sprint reviews follow IMRaD: in each sprint, one of
     these is the central concern.
   #+end_quote
3. What's the purpose of a sprint review in Scrum?
   #+begin_quote
   Presentation of a prototype, which is whatever the project team has
   created by then (perhaps nothing). It's not the same as a milestone
   (which is a date at which a particular result is expected).
   #+end_quote
4. Which of these do not apply to the projects in this course:
   - [ ] Use a project from another course in this class.
   - [ ] Explore a dataset of your choice that you are curious about.
   - [ ] Explore an R or Python package of your choice.
   - [ ] Complete a DataCamp competition and report on it.
   - [ ] Create a demo that your audience can participate in.
5. True or false? Does this course have a final exam?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes it does but it's optional: you only have to write the final
   exam if you're unhappy with your grade and want to improve it. If
   your final exam result is worse than your final grade up to that
   point, it won't be counted.
   #+end_quote
6. True or false? You can complete your DataCamp assignments any time.
   #+begin_quote
   True - but you will suffer a 50% point loss for late completion.
   #+end_quote
7. What is "Google Cloud Shell"?
   #+begin_quote
   A free cloud application that offers an editor (looks like VSCode)
   and a command-line or shell program. Allows 50 hours computing time
   per week and 5GB of space. The Emacs installation is permanent, the
   installation of R, alas, is not.
   #+end_quote
8. What does =sudo apt install emacs= mean?
   #+begin_quote
   1. =sudo=: gives you admin rights for what follows, requires passwprd
   2. =apt=: package manager program for Debian-like Linux distros
   3. =install=: install the following program (if it can be found)
   #+end_quote
9. What is =wget=?
   #+begin_quote
   GNU =wget= is a non-interactive network downloader. It's one of many
   GNU utilities that Linux uses. =wget= works in the background. Check
   out [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html][the manual page online]] (or in Linux).
   #+end_quote
10. What are the advantages of DataCamp assignments?
    #+begin_quote
    - The assignments are online & asynchronous (do them when you want)
    - The lessons (often) come with videos and textbook material
    - You can practice what you've learnt (5 questions per day)
    - You can work through DataCamp on the desktop or on your phone
    - You can use completed courses to get internships and work
    - You can use [[https://datacamp.com/datalab][DataLab]] as an interactive notebook (similar to Emacs)
    #+end_quote

** Finish Google Cloud Shell exercise ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/main/org/1_infrastructure_Google_Cloud_Shell.org][GitHub]])

Head over to =shell.cloud.google.com=. You should get to the terminal
right away. Move the editor out of the way, then continue the
exercise to the end:

1. Install Google Cloud Shell app using Chrome: login, and then:
   =Settings > Save and Share > Install page as app=
3. Emacs is actually pre-installed.
4. Install R 
5. Open Emacs
6. Create an Org-mode file 
7. Run R
8. Close Emacs
9. Watch your quota (50 hours/week)

** Start Birkenkrahe's Emacs Tutorial ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1/blob/main/org/1_infrastructure_Emacs.org][GitHub]])

1. You'll get a handout. Online: [[https://tinyurl.com/emacs-tutor][tinyurl.com/emacs-tutor]].
2. Code along with me using Emacs in the cloud.
3. Finish at home if necessary.

Note: some keybindings are not available because you're using Emacs in
a browser - most notably =C-n= (CTRL + n) and =C-v= (CTRL + v) use the
arrow keys =<Down>= and =<FN><PgDown>= instead.

** Datalab demo (GitHub)

DataCamp's DataLab and Google's Colab or RStudio are alternatives to
Emacs + Org-mode that you want to know about (and also so that you can
appreciate what our infrastructure brings to the table).

You'll get a handout of the exercise (PDF).
