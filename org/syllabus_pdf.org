* Objectives

Data science is concerned with getting data to work for us, to give us
its (presumed) hidden treasures. Data science has been called "the
sexiest job of the 21st century". Even if you don't want to become a
professonial data scientist, it's helpful to master the basic concepts
if you want to succeed in today's data-driven business.

* Target audience

The course is for anyone who is interested in becoming more data
literate in their own field of interest - be it languages, theatre,
biology, psychology or exercise science - and growing their personal
skill stack. Visualization of data-driven insights and improved
productivity when working with data and media is a concern for any
professional.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete "Introduction to data science" (DSC 105) will be
able to:

- Learn computer and data science principles by playing with data
- Acquire basic programming skills using Python, R, SQL, and bash
- Apply literate programming principles by working with Org-mode
- Use infrastructure including command line, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub
- Understand the relationship of humans, machines, and data
- Develop their critical thinking skills
- Learn how to effectively use AI coding assistants like Copilot, Code
  Interpreter (ChatGPT)
- Understand the impact of, and can code in R, Python, SQL, bash
- Know how to effectively present assignment and project results

Students, who complete DSC 105 will have fulfilled the prerequisites
for DSC 205, Introduction to advanced data science, which focuses on
advanced practices in data exploration, visualization, and integration
with databases and other languages through R and Python packages and
APIs.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: Introduction to Programming (either CSC100 or
CSC115 or CSC109, and MTH101 (College Algebra).

Otherwise no prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and
experience with computers and/or programming is useful but not
critical. Curiosity is essential. You will gain data literacy skills
by taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use modern
computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to zoology).

* Grading

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION            | IMPACT |
|---------+------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | DataCamp assignments   |    25% |
| Monthly | Project sprint reviews |    25% |
| Weekly  | Tests                  |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)  |    25% |

- DataCamp is an online learning platform for data science
- Sprint reviews are monthly group project progress reports
- Tests are open-book multiple choice exams to be completed at home
- The final exam is optional if you want to improve your grade

* Rubric

* Learning management system

- We use Lyon's Canvas installation for this course.
- The home page contains: assignments, grades, pages, people,
  syllabus, quizzes, Google Drive, Course evaluation and Zoom.
- The Zoom page includes cloud recordings of all past sessions.
- Recorded sessions will be deleted after the last class.

* DataCamp

- The course includes a free subscription to the DataCamp classroom at
  [[https://datacamp.com/][datacamp.com]] for further study, and the opportunity to earn
  certificates. DataCamp is a popular data science online learning
  platform.

- We will use the [[https://datacamp.com/datalab][DataLab workspace]] that comes with the DataCamp
  subscription will be our usual stomping to experiment with either
  Python or R.

* GitHub

All course materials are available in a public GitHub repository
([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1][github.com/birkenkrahe/ds1]]). Registration for students includes a
free subscription to GitHub Codespaces with the AI coding assistant
Copilot (you need to provide proof of student status yourself). GitHub
is the worldwide largest online platform for software development.
