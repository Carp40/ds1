* Vectors and Matrices (DataCamp) popquiz & =NA= extension

1. Create a vector =temp= of temperatures predicted for next week. The
   temperatures (from Monday to Friday) were: 76, 75, 77, 79, 81.
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

2. Create a vector =week= of weekdays from Monday (Mon) to Friday (Fri):
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

3. Name the =temp= vector according to days of =week=:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

4. Print temperatures that are not below 80 degrees Fahrenheit:
   #+begin_src R
     
   #+end_src

5. Compute the average of the temperatures for the =week=:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

6. Compute the average of the temperature for the =week= without the
   days on which the temperature was at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

7. Create an unnamed vector =temp2= from =temp=:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

8. Convert the vector =temp2= into a 1 x 5 =matrix= =temp_m=:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

9. Name the columns of the matrix according to =week= names:
   #+begin_src R

   #+end_src

10. Compute the average temperature without using the =mean= function:
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

11. Compute the average temperature using the =mean= function:
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

12. Compute the average temperature with =mean= only for the days where
    the temperature was greater or equal 80 degrees Fahrenheit:
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

13. Add a row of missing values to the matrix and store it in =temp_m2=:
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

14. Compute the average temperature of =temp_m2= using =mean=:
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src

15. Compute the average temperature with =mean= only for the days where
    the temperature was lower than 80 degrees Fahrenheit (Mon-Thu):
    #+begin_src R

    #+end_src
