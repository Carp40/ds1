You should use standard meta data that Emacs can read when it renders
documents, like in your assignments: =#+TITLE:=, =#+AUTHOR:=, and =#+SUBTITLE:=.

Your headlines should use standard syntax, too: =*=, =**= etc. 

If you improve these things, your document will be more readable and
also much more easy to work with.

#+PROJECT IDEA: The goal of this project is to combine historical performance/stats
                with current conditions to come up with a formula to help analyze
                who the top HB will be in the upcoming NFL season

#+begin_notes MB
As your customer, am I supposed to know what "HP" and "NFL" is? Always
define acronyms when you first use them (if you use them again).

In terms of purpose, this is ambitious and you seem to want to do
predictive analytics but I am not sure you have the technical skills
to do this. If you don't do it yourself you can still take other
people's data and publications - but doing your own analysis is more
fun - in your team, Braden has done a project (solo), he can tell you.

#+PROBLEM: The probelm we are trying to solve is, we want to find a formula
           using previous years stats and trends to help up make an accurate assumption
           on who the top HB's in the league will be for the upcoming NFL season

#+begin_notes MB
Seems a little fast written - typo here, and above there are
others. Make sure you take enough time before you submit - you're
three people who can check each other's stuff, and you have one month
between sprint reviews.

When you say 'formula', you probably mean a model. If you mean a
mathematical formula then you're probably out of luck unless you know
a lot more than I do. Instead, you are probably better advised to do
some exploratory analysis with existing data to identify patterns,
create visuals based on these, and find out which variables/features
contribute to a team's success. That's work which you must do before
attempting to find any "formula".

#+CONSTRAINTS: Some difficulties we will have with this project is
               1. Which stats will we use to incorporate into our formula
               2. What our formula will be
               3. How many years back do we want to go to get an accuarte pool of data

#+begin_notes MB
1 and 3 are excellent questions, not so much constraints. First
though: which data and where from? The second question is
ill-defined. You can split goals amongst yourselves too.

Constraints include things that may help or hinder your success. Data
availability, skill set, people to ask etc.

#+GOALS: 1. Analyzing large pools of stats and better understanding how to find
           useful information within the numbers
     
         2.Coming up with a formula using past stats and trends

         3. Better understand how to code using data sets

#+begin_notes MB
1 AND 3 are good - though you need to define "useful information" in
the context of your application (sports). "Code using data sets" is
all what R is about. Getting to know complicated data and finding some
patterns may be sufficient.

#+Non-Goals: 1.Perfect accuracy in the results
             2. Predicting injuries that can occur throughout the season
         

#+METRICES: We will measure if our project is succesful or not by 
            1. If our formula is able to give us names of players that project to do good
            2. If we check back at the end of the NFL season and some of our answers
               are actually top performers in the NFL for this season

#+begin_notes MB
Metrics can also include things you're looking for in the data. For
this and for the next section (references) you need to check the
literature (what's been published in this field already and how people
have done this) - that's also your next sprint review deliverable.

Sometimes all you need and can do is check and work through other
people's work and you'd be surprised how easy it is often to find
mistakes.

You need more references and you're not referencing some things you
need to reference. For example, are you going to work with R? You also
don't need long links/URLs in a reference, but inline links, [[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/#:~:text=Pro%20Football%20Stats%2C%20History%2C%20Scores,Pro%2DReference.com][like this]].

References need to be consistent (all of the same format) and
complete.
