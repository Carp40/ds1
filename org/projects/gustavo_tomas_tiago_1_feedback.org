I added feedback and suggestions for fixes in =comment= blocks. Please
address all suggestions as soon as possible but no later than the next
sprint review (Oct 11).

* Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to leverage R for analyzing player
performance in teamsports by utilizing event data metrics such as
passes, tackles, shots and saves. This framework aims to help teams
identify overperforming and underperforming players, pinpoint areas
for improvement, and select the best players for specific game plans
or playstyles.

* Reason

Understanding player performance is crucial for teams to enhance their
strategies and outcomes. By leveraging data analytics, teams can make
informed decisions about player selection and training focus,
ultimately leading to better performance on the fIeld.

#+begin_comment
From talking to Gustavo, I recall that there were more pressing
concerns, namely that the current system of data analysis at Lyon
Soccer is broken. This should be mentioned, and you should research
it.

* Constraints

- Technical: Integrating and processing large datasets from various sources
  may present challenges. Ensuring data accuracy and consistency
  is vital for reliable performance analysis.
- Conceptual: Developing metrics that accurately reflect player contributions
  without being overly simplistic or misleading.
- Personal: Balancing this project with other assignments, because it is
  hard to tell the difficulties and complexities of this project,
  also that I would be doing by myself, impacting project depth
  and quality.

* Goals
1. Create a comprehensive set of performance metrics derived from
   event data.

   #+begin_comment
   This is doable. For the next sprint review (methodology) you need
   to break this step down into more steps and split them up among
   team members to do.

2. Develop a visual dashboard to present player performance
   analytics.

   #+begin_comment
   This is probably too much though with Power BI or Tableau you could
   give it a try. The dashboard project is a good project for the data
   visualization class (DSC 302). You could also review existing
   dashboards for this type of data.

3. Conduct case studies on specific players or teams to validate the
   framework.
   #+begin_comment
   This means that you would gather primary data from human subject
   unless you only use yourselves, which I would recommend to avoid
   having to talk to Lyon's Institutional Review Board.

   In any case, you ought to test your framework & specify what
   exactly you're going to deliver as part of it. A framework usually
   is a reusable set of guidelines and tools that a developer can use
   to build software applications (e.g. a dashboard).

   So this needs to be much more specific and you need to turn it into
   a series of well-defined steps so that you know what every team
   member must do every week. If you don't know that, you didn't break
   it down enough.

* Non Goals

- Conducting extensive qualitative analysis of player behavior.
- Covering all possible sports; this project will focus on one
  specific sport.

#+begin_comment
This is a good identification of your non-goals.
#+end_comment

* Metrics

- Accuracy of performance metrics compared to expert evaluations.
- Feedback from coaches on the utility of the performance insights.

#+begin_comment
Both of these are very good.

The Opta Sports URL does not work, please fix it. The references
should be: 1) consistently cited (same format - they all seem to have
different format), 2) complete (the last one is not complete. Please
fix that.
