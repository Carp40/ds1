I add feedback and suggestions for fixes in =comment= blocks. Please
address all suggestions as soon as possible but no later than the next
sprint review (Oct 11), that is for your next deliverable.

Your proposal is missing the proper formatting for an Org-mode
file. Use the meta data header of any of my lecture files for title,
author, subtitle and status meta data.

Use M-q to auto-indent long lines of text, and `-` for bullet
points. You seem to have copied this from WORD or something. Use `#`
for headlines, and C-c C-l to hide links behind the text.

Since I don't want to do your job for you, I'm going to put all my
comments in this top blob.

1. Problem seems interesting. What are the "top three streaming
   platforms"? Which content? Music, games, news? If you don't know
   this yet it becomes also part of the project. "User engagement" and
   "content diversity" are not immediately quantifiable (they're
   derived metrics).

2. Your next deliverable is a literature review. You need to improve
   your citation technique. References must be consistent (same
   format) and complete - yours aren't either of these, please fix for
   the next submission. Not sure why you put Emacs in the
   references. As a software? You can get the way R ought to be cited
   from R itself, with the command `citation()`.

3. Your data sources and your metrics are the crucial ingredients. Not
   clear where you will get the (public) data from
   exactly. "Consumers" for these platforms is also not clear: are
   these subscribers? Casual users, viewers? Revenue/growth can be
   validated.

4. To identify the right platforms, data, metrics, you may want to be
   more specific what exactly you're looking for. You're not
   investors, or developers, or influencers yourself, I presume, but
   customers - and perhaps you want to work for these platforms. Your
   project will have the greatest energy if you find something you
   really want to know and that you already know something about.

   Otherwise - well done!

Proposal

Problem:

The project aims to analyze and visualize data from the top three
streaming platforms over the last five years to determine which
platform is the most influential and effective for the users. This
involves evaluating various metrics such as user growth, revenue,
content diversity, and user engagement.

Reasons:

Understanding which streaming platform stands out in terms of
influence and effectiveness is valuable for multiple stakeholders like
consumers and creators. For consumers, it gives ideas about the
platform which provide proper and good content without unnecessary
content. It also gives the best idea to choose which platform and
which services to use. For creators, it helps identify best platform
to partner with based on reach and engagement on them.

Constraints:

· Technical: Some platforms may not provide every data to
public. Combining data from different source may require significant
effort in terms of standardizing formats and handling inconsistencies.

· Conceptual: Choosing the right metrics to measure influence and
effectiveness can be a little subjective and may vary based on each
perspective.

· Personal: Specific skills and tools may need for advance
analysis. Time management can be another one.

Goals:

· Conducting a comparative analysis of top three streaming platforms
based on selected metrics.

· Creating a clear and compressive visualization to represent trends
and comparisons.

· Giving some recommendation based on the analysis to guide consumers
and creators.

Non-Goals:

· Using the data of only five years (which may change in future but
never above 5).

· Technical performance reviews of the platforms are not part of the
scope.

· Only the top three platforms will be given priority and not others.

Metrics

· Change in the consumer numbers.

· Annual revenue figures and growth rates.

· Number of titles and genres available.

· Overall market share relative to other platforms.
