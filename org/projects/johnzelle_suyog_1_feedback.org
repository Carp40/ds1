I add feedback and suggestions for fixes in =comment= blocks. Please
address all suggestions as soon as possible but no later than the next
sprint review (Oct 11).

Your proposal is missing the proper formatting for an Org-mode
file. Use the meta data header of any of my lecture files for title,
author, subtitle and status meta data.

Use M-q to auto-indent long lines of text, and `-` for bullet
points. You seem to have copied this from WORD or something. Use `#`
for headlines, and C-c C-l to hide links behind the text.

Since I don't want to do your job for you, I'm going to put all my
comments in this top blob.

1. *Proposal* - this should be part of the =#+title:= of the document.

2. *Problem* seems interesting. What are the "top three streaming
   platforms", and are you talking about movie, news, games streaming?
   If you don't know this yet it can also become part of the
   project. "User engagement" and "content diversity" are not
   immediately quantifiable (they're derived metrics).

3. *Reasons*: Do you also have personal reasons? This would be useful to
   mention.

Proposal

Problem:

The project aims to analyze and visualize data from the top three
streaming platforms over the last five years to determine which
platform is the most influential and effective for the users. This
involves evaluating various metrics such as user growth, revenue,
content diversity, and user engagement.

Reasons:

Understanding which streaming platform stands out in terms of
influence and effectiveness is valuable for multiple stakeholders like
consumers and creators. For consumers, it gives ideas about the
platform which provide proper and good content without unnecessary
content. It also gives the best idea to choose which platform and
which services to use. For creators, it helps identify best platform
to partner with based on reach and engagement on them.

Constraints:

· Technical: Some platforms may not provide every data to public. Combining data from different source may require significant effort in terms of standardizing formats and handling inconsistencies.

· Conceptual: Choosing the right metrics to measure influence and effectiveness can be a little subjective and may vary based on each perspective.

· Personal: Specific skills and tools may need for advance analysis. Time management can be another one.

Goals:

· Conducting a comparative analysis of top three streaming platforms based on selected metrics.

· Creating a clear and compressive visualization to represent trends and comparisons.

· Giving some recommendation based on the analysis to guide consumers and creators.

Non-Goals:

· Using the data of only five years (which may change in future but never above 5).

· Technical performance reviews of the platforms are not part of the scope.

· Only the top three platforms will be given priority and not others.

Metrics

· Change in the consumer numbers.

· Annual revenue figures and growth rates.

· Number of titles and genres available.

· Overall market share relative to other platforms.
