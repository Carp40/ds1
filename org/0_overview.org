IMRaD is the framework for all scientific publications:
#+begin_quote
- Introduction (research question - what you want to find out)
- Method (how you want to do it)
- Results (what you found out)
- Discussion (what it means)

([[https://youtu.be/dip7UwZ3wUM][Video: Research Writing with IMRaD]])

#+begin_quote
- Explore and document an R or Python package of your choice
- Document an extended analysis example ([[https://www.r-bloggers.com/][in R]], Python, or SQL[fn:3])
- Explore a data set of your choice (e.g. soccer, finance, sales data)
- Complete a [[https://www.datacamp.com/data-science-competitions][DataCamp competition]] and report on it!
- See [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects][DataCamp projects]] for more examplesx
- You can double/triple up on projects if you're in > 1 of my
  courses[fn:4]
- Use problems from other courses for your project, e.g. data
  collected by yourself, or data in economics, business, art etc.

- Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline;
  after the deadline, you can play them an unlimited number of times
- There will be a revision quiz on Canvas every week, consisting of
  several multiple choice, matching and true/false questions.
- A subset of the test questions will form the final exam (25% of your
  final grade) - the exam is optional for you to improve your grade.
#+end_quote

* First home assignments
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/home.jpg]]

- Register with DataCamp now if you haven't done it yet ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2628/pages/course-links][links]]).
- Complete chapter 1 of the course "Understanding Data Science",
  [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-data-science][Introduction to data science]] on the DataCamp platform.

* Next: GitHub + Git / Emacs + Org-mode
* Footnotes

[fn:1]There are good reasons to choose R over Python as a first
language for data science students. Unfortunately, the dominance of
the "Tidyverse" ideology negates this slight advantage. Still, for
visualization and statistical analysis, R is still superior, IMHO.

[fn:2]These video lectures follow the GitHub scripts and practice
files, and are motivated by pp. 1-55 of the book by Tuckfield (2023).

[fn:3]Or in another language: Julia, bash, or data analysis apps like
PowerBi or Tableau come to mind - you can find examples at [[https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial][DataCamp]].

[fn:4]If you do use the same project topic in more than one of my
courses, talk to me to make sure that the projects differ
sufficiently.

[fn:5]If you wish to use DataCamp beyond the end of the term, contact
me and I can add you to next term's workspace.
